# NoLongerEvil iOS

This is a SwiftUI iOS test client for the NoLongerEvil hosted service. It is a prototype and not a production ready app. I do not have an active Apple developer account right now so this isn't published as a build anywhere and I don't think I can have GitHub action build one without a paid developer account. 

I know the mode selector works, changing the set point works however, I haven't tested the set points in auto mode yet. The fan control should work, no timere yet. 

This needs a lot more work that I'll get to in my free time. I am not an iOS dev so feel free to chine in should you see something or have an improvment. 

## Setup

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run on a simulator or device.
3. Open Settings in the app.
4. Enter your API URL and API key, then save.

You can get your API key from `nolongerevil.com` in your account settings.

## Notes

- This project is a test/prototype and is not production-ready.
- Large parts of the UI and logic were built with AI assistance and may need review or refactoring.
